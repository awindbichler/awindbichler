## Disclaimer
In case you have feedback to any code I might commit in future:
- please do not judge my code
- it's just a hobby
- my poor code quality does not reflect the great code quality<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup> of our company

You just have way too much feedback on my code and need to do something about it? You would do it preferably right away from scratch and clean? You have ideas how to improve or enhance it? In that case please fill out my [feedback form](https://anx.io/Y3B39).
